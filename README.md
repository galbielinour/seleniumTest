# seleniumTest
This repository is dedicated to save personal trial script for testing because there are no testing unit in my office.

My role is to support all testing needed for a ticketing website in development environment. There are many flows of ticket based on some flag, and there are data that not available on the development website. Therefore, these scripts help me in complete testing efficiently.

Previously, I had to find data first to create a ticket based on the requirement testing, and it took time to find it. After I create the script, I could create tiket by duplicate it from Production and focus on the item that need to be test.

Then for search ticket, there are many elements or details in the ticket and it can be find by search the detail on a specific column shown on searching page. Because of there are many columns to be test, I make the script to do the job.
